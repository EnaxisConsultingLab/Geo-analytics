Their home, located at: 8923 Melody Park in Houston, 77044, was flooded out. The boat that came to rescue Gil and his 13 family members, including a new born baby, could not fit their 4 dogs onto the boat.
They had to leave their dogs behind and they are worried, heartbroken and panicking. They are begging for someone or a group to help save them.
